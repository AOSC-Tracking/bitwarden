 * An instance of {@link NotificationsService} that throws if it is called at all. It is currently

 *
 * In the future, the `notifications$` property can be exposed and WOULD be allowed to be called,
 * this instance would then connect up a port or message stream from the background. This requires that
 * all notifications would need to be deserializable.
